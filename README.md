Make sure seditHelp.txt is in the same directory as sedit.py!
Make sure to execute the program with the name of the file you want to edit in the Bash command (ex: python3 sedit.py test.txt)
Sedit will check whether the file exists or not, if it doesn't, it will automatically create it.
You will then be greeted by the ':' prompt. Refer to COMMANDS section for the command you can use.
