SEDIT - Simple Text Editor
Welcome to sedit! This is a very simple text editor written in Python.

-- USE --
Make sure to execute the program with the name of the file you want to edit in the Bash command (ex: python3 sedit.py test.txt)
Sedit will check whether the file exists or not, if it doesn't, it will automatically create it.
You will then be greeted by the ':' prompt. Refer to COMMANDS section for the command you can use.

-- MODES --
Edit Mode: 
WARNING: This option deletes the contents of the file. Use only to edit newly created files. 
Hit ENTER to go to the next line. Keep in mind that you cannot edit that line after you hit ENTER.
To exit edit mode, simply hit ENTER, then SPACE, then ENTER again in that order.
If you want to edit a line after you already hit ENTER, use INSERT/APPEND mode
Insert/Append Mode: 
Refer to the COMMANDS section for command syntax. Edits an individual line from the file. This option keeps the file intact but
can only edit one line at a time
Delete Mode:
Deletes the chosen line

-- COMMANDS --
':n' - New file mode. Truncates the file and starts Edit Mode.
':i x' - Insert/Append mode, the 'x' is the line you want to edit.
':d x' - Delete mode. The 'x' is the line you want to delete.
':l' - Prints out the contents of the file
':h' - Prints out the help file

Enjoy.
